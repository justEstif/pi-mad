## Grade Scale

| Grade | %      | Meaning                     |
| ----- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| A     | 90%+   | Production-ready            |
| B     | 80–89% | Minor improvements needed   |
| C     | 70–79% | Clear improvement path      |
| D     | 60–69% | Significant issues          |
| F     | <60%   | Fundamental redesign needed |

Grade = total scored / total applicable max (as %).

## Group Detection

```
[ ] SKILL.md?                  → U + S (120 pts)
[ ] AGENTS.md / system prompt? → U + C (120 pts)
[ ] Contains bash/shell rules? → Also + B (150 pts max)
[ ] Other?                     → U only (80 pts)
```

Multiple groups apply additively.

**Spec Cache** (for S1 scoring only): `~/.claude/tmp/agentskills-spec-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Glob for today → read if found → else WebFetch `https://agentskills.io/specification` → write to cache.
